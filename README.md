// If movie is truthy (i.e., it exists and is not null, undefined, 0, "", false, etc.), the expression evaluates to movie.backdrop_path.

For example, if movie is an object with a backdrop_path property, it will return the value of backdrop_path.

If movie is falsy, the expression short-circuits and returns movie. This is a safety measure to prevent potential errors if movie is null or undefined.
